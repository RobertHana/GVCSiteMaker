To run the following examples the CLASSPATH variable must contain
jass.jar and the directory where jass was extracted.

Examples: Simple example can be run through:
--------- 

1.) java jass.Jass examples\Buffer.jass
2.) java jass.Jass examples\UnlimitedBuffer.jass
3.) java jass.Jass examples\BufferTest.jass
4.) javac examples\BufferTest.java
5.) java jass.examples.BufferTest

Modifications of the class BufferTest can easyly produce some
assertion exceptions.

Another nice examples is the file ProducerConsumer. The result varies
from the scheduling of the threads.  You can test the interference
check with:

   java jass.Jass interference examples\BufferTest.jass

A HTML-Description of the Jass grammar can be found in the
docs/grammars directory.


ATTENTION: 
---------- 

The dataflow option cost a lot of time for big classes with many
calls. The dataflow option is enabled if the interference mode is
used, or if the optimize option is set. Optimize is turned of BY
DEFAULT.

Known Bugs:
