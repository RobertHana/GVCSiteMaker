  <title>How to Use Eclipse At GVC</title>
</head>


<body>




<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>This document describes how to install and configure Eclipse for use at GVC.  It 
will not teach you the specifics of how to use Eclipse, or cover the details of
our Java coding standard.</p>




<h1>Installing <img src="http://www.eclipse.org/images/EclipseBannerPic.jpg"></h1>


<p>The Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Home Page</a>.<br>

<br>


You can download it from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/">here</a>.  
You want version 3.2.1<br>

<br>


On <b>Win2K</b>, install Eclipse to a path with no spaces, e.g. C:\Programs<br>

<br>


On <b>OS X</b>, Eclipse will unpack to the desktop.  Move it to&nbsp;/Developer/Applications/eclipse.<br>

<br>

</p>




<h1>Getting the Basics Down</h1>


<p>Before you go further, it is a good idea to go through the tutorials and get familiar with 
the terminology and mechanics of the Eclipse IDE.  Launch Eclipse and read the
Welcome page.  Then open the Help system (<i>Help Contents</i> option on the <i>Help</i> menu).</p>


<p>The first thing to do is to get familiar with the contents of the Workbench (
the IDE).  Open the <b>Workbench User Guide</b> and follow the <b>Basic Tutorial</b> part of the
<b>Getting Started</b> chapter.  Don't worry about the <b>Team CVS</b> and <b>Ant</b> tutorials.
We don't use CVS and leaning Ant should wait.</p>


<p>Notice the <b>Concepts</b>, <b>Tasks</b>, and <b>Tips and Tricks</b> sections of this user guide.  
You will find these useful later on.  Try learning a new tip each day until you
have mastered them all.</p>

 
<p>Now that you are familiar with the Workbench it is time to move on to Java specific
functionality.  Open the <b>Java Development User Guide</b> and follow the <b>Basic Tutorial</b> 
part of the <b>Getting Started</b> chapter.  Don't worry about the <b>Project Configuration
Tutorial</b>.  Again, notice the <b>Concepts</b>, <b>Tasks</b>, and <b>Tips and Tricks</b> 
sections of this user guide.<br>

<br>

</p>






<h1>Extending Eclipse with Plug-ins</h1>


<p>One of the great strengths of the Eclipse platform is that it is easy to extend
it through the use of plug-in modules.</p>



<h2>WOLips / WOProject <img src="http://objectstyle.org/woproject/images/wolips_logo.gif"></h2>

  
<p>The most important of these plug-in modules to the work that we do is 
<a href="http://www.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/Home">WOLips/WOProject</a>. WOLips provides 
excellent support for WebObjects development in Eclipse.  The easiest way to install
(or update) WOLips is via the Eclipse Update Manager. Here are <a href="http://www.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/Install+WOLips+with+Eclipse+Update+Manager">instructions</a>.</p>
WOLips is controlled by the settings in the file&nbsp;<code>Library/wobuild.properties</code>
which is found in your home directory (~/ on OS X, or C:\Documents and Settings\UserID on Win2K.  
Take a minute to look at this and verify that it is correct.  An example of this file:

<pre>#This file stores the wo specific properties<br>#Wed Oct 11 19:51:09 PDT 2006<br>wo.dir.root=/<br>wo.woroot=/System<br>wo.dir.user.home.library.frameworks=/Users/chuck/Library/Frameworks<br>wo.dir.local=/<br>wo.wosystemroot=/System<br>wo.dir.library=/System/Library<br>wo.dir.user.home.library=/Users/chuck/Library<br>wo.dir.local.library=/Library<br>wo.dir.library.frameworks=/System/Library/Frameworks<br>wo.dir.local.library.frameworks=/Library/Frameworks<br>wo.wolocalroot=/<br>wo.dir.system=/System<br>wo.dir.reference.api=/Developer/ADC%20Reference%20Library/documentation/WebObjects/Reference/API/</pre>





<p>Support for <a href="http://csd.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/%7Ejass/">Jass</a> 
Design by Contract (DBC) is provided by special tasks in GVC's version of build.xml.
Details on the integration can be found <a href="AntReadMe.html">here</a>.<br>

 You can use the same technique to turn on any of the other features of the Tab
Navigator that you want to use.</p>

<br>




<h1>Configuring Eclipse the GVC Way</h1>


<p>Here are a few things that you need to do so that your projects will compile and 
so that your fellow team members will not lynch you.</p>

<br>

<br>




<h2>jUnit Support</h2>


<p>Support for running <a href="http://www.junit.org">jUnit</a> tests is built into Eclipse.  
However; in order to compile sub-classes of jUnit classes, <code>junit.jar</code> needs to be on the
class path.  We do this by defining a special class path variable, <code><b>JUNIT</b></code>.  The easiest thing to
point it to is the <code>junit.jar</code> in the jUnit plug-in that comes with Eclipse:</p>


<img src="images/JUnitVariable.jpg" border="0"><br>

<br>



<h2>log4j Support</h2>


<p>In order to compile classes using <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j</a>, a 
<code>log4j*.jar</code> needs to be in the class path.  We do this by defining a special class path variable, 
<code><b>LOG4J</b></code>.  The easiest thing to point it to is the log4j jar file in 
<code>/Library/WebObjects/Extesions</code>.  See jUnit support above for GUI example.


</p>

<h2>Jass Support</h2>


<h3>Locate the jass-rt.jar</h3>


In order to run contracted code, <code>jass-rt.jar</code> needs to be on the
class path.  We do this by defining a special class path variable, <code><b>JASS</b></code>.  
The easiest thing to point it to is the <code>jass-rt.jar</code> in the GVC's Jass Plugin for Eclipse:<br>

<br>

<br>



<h3>Add a Builder for Jass</h3>


<font color="red">After you do this, be certain to add the new <b>.externalToolBuilders</b> folder to StarTeam!</font><br>

<br>


Go to the project's properties, and select Builders.  Uncheck the <b>WOLips Ant Builder</b> (the Jass builder does this step too).  
Leave the <b>Java Builder</b> checked.  This builder is not required, but helps to provide better error feedback in Eclipse for things
like method references that become invalid when a method is renamed (instead of refactoring).  After unchecking the <b>WOLips Ant Builder</b>, 
click New... and select Ant Build:<br>

<br>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep1.jpg"><br>

<br>


<p>Give it a <b>Name</b> like <i>ProjectName</i> Jass Builder.  This name needs to be unqiue in the workspace.  You can't just name it
Jass Builder.  Next to <b>Buildfile</b>, click <b>Browse Workspace...</b> and select the build.xml file from the project:</p>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep2.jpg"><br>

<br>


<p>Next to <b>Base Directory</b>, click <b>Browse Workspace...</b> and select the project:</p>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep3.jpg"><br>

<br>


<p>Go to the <b>Refresh</b> tab, click <b>Refresh resources upon completion</b> and check off <b>The project containing the selected 
resource</b>:</p>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep4.jpg"><br>

<br>


<p>Go to the <b>Targets</b> tab, uncheck <b>build (default target)</b> and check off <b>jass.builder</b>:</p>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep5.jpg"><br>

<br>


<p>Go to the <b>Build Options</b> tab, and check off <b>During Auto Builds</b>:</p>


<img src="images/CreateJassAntBuilderStep6.jpg"><br>

<br>



<h3>Turing Jass Off and On</h3>


To turn Jass off, go to the project's properties, and select Builders.  Check <b>Java Builder</b> and <b>WOLips Ant Builder</b> 
then uncheck the Jass Builder.  To turn Jass on, unheck <b>Java Builder</b> and <b>WOLips Ant Builder</b> 
then check off the Jass Builder.<br>

<br>


<h2>Standard Code Formatting</h2>



<p>There are some things you must configure on your workbench so that we all
produce consistently formatted code.  If you fail to do this we will be forever
tripping over formatting differences when checking in code.  You are required to 
make these configuration settings, they are not a matter of personal preference.</p>



<p>Open the <b>Preferences</b> window and select the <b>Java</b> - <b>Code Formatter</b> option.  
Set the <b>New Line</b> tab options like this:</p>


<img src="images/CodeFormatterNewLines.jpg" border="0">


<p>On the <b>Line Splitting</b> tab, set the <b>Maximum Line Length</b> to 100.
This number only takes effect if you tell Eclipse to reformat your source.  The results
of doing this are not always pleasing.  You can set the editor's Print Margin to 100
and ask it to display the print margin so that you can see where lines will break.</p>



<p>Set the <b>Style</b> tab options like this:</p>


<img src="images/CodeFormatterStyle.jpg" border="0">

<p>Select the <b>Java</b> - <b>Code Generation</b> option and select the <b>Code and Comments</b> tab. 
Import the file <code>GVCCodeAndComments.xml</code> from the same directory as this file:</p>


<img src="images/ImportCodeGenerationComments.jpg" border="0">



<p>Select the <b>Java</b> - <b>Compiler</b> option. 
Set the <b>Problems</b> tab options like this:</p>


<img src="images/CompilerProblems.jpg" border="0">

<p>Set the <b>Style</b> tab options like this:</p>


<img src="images/CompilerStyle.jpg" border="0">


<p>Select the <b>Java</b> - <b>Installed JREs</b> option. 
Remove any versions (anything other than 1.3.1) that you will not be using:</p>


<img src="images/InstalledJRE.jpg" border="0">

<p>Select the <b>Java</b> - <b>Organize Imports</b> option. 
Set the number of ipmortes needed for <b>.*</b> to <b>5</b> and load the file 
<code>GVCTools.importorder</code> from the same directory as this file:</p>


<img src="images/ImportOrder.jpg" border="0">


<h1>Organization Through Multiple Workspaces</h1>


<p>One way to organize your work is to have every framework and every application for 
every project you've ever worked on open in your workspace.  You can open and close the
projects as needed.</p>



<p>An alternative is to have one workspace per project.  This reduces the clutter in your
workspace at the expense of requiring more configuration time.  You will need to
re-do all the configuration in the previous section (not the plugins) for each 
workspace that you create.  It is a personal choice.</p>



<p>If you decide to with multiple workspaces, here is what to do.  Create a short cut / 
alias to eclipse.  Pass it a data parameter to where you want to the workspace information 
stored.  This does not have to be where the code is stored, it is just configuration information.
Just be sure that it is not the same place that you have already used for another workspace.  
The shortcut will look like this in Windows:<br>


<code>U:\Programs\eclipse\eclipse.exe -data "U:\Projects\GVCSiteMaker\Code\Workspace"</code></p>
