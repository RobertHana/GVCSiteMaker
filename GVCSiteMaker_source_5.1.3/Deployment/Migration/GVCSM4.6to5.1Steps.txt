0. Add ValidDomains to your config file:
ValidDomains    = ("www.global-village.net", "global-village.net", "gvcsitemaker.com", "www.gvcsitemaker.com");

1. Run DataConversionFrom4.6To5.0_Script.sql


STEP BELOW ARE TO CONVERT YOUR PKs TO BYTE(24)

2. Write out the database to text using
write all output (dir='/wherever/', content=true);

3. Run convert_exported_data_to_byte24.sh on the directory, like so:
./convert_exported_data_to_byte24.sh /whatever/

4. Copy the table creation statements (only) out "clusteringschema.sql", and replace the create table statements in the schema.sql file you created in #2.  Then, in schema.sql, search for sm_website.  In the create table statement that follows, change this line:
"SITE_ID" CHARACTER VARYING(150) COLLATE "UMICH"."CASEINSENSITIVE",

to
"SITE_ID" CHARACTER VARYING(150) COLLATE "your schema"."CASEINSENSITIVE",

where "your schema" is the user that has all the SiteMaker data.  You can find it by looking for these lines at the top of schema.sql:
CREATE SCHEMA "your schema" AUTHORIZATION "your schema"
CREATE COLLATION "CASEINSENSITIVE" FOR "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."SQL_TEXT" FROM EXTERNAL('CaseInsensitive.coll1')

5. Re-create the database using the edited schema.sql and munged data.

If your database is large, it can happen that FB will crash while re-creating the database.  If this happens, you will need to split the schema.sql file into 2 (or more) segments.  Recreate the database and run the first segment, ensure that it executed cleanly, then shut down the database, restart the database, and run the second segment.  FB may take a while to shut down, during which time it will be unable to restart, so if you try to start the database and get an error, wait a few seconds longer and try again.
