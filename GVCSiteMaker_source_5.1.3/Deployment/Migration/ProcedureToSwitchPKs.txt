1) Quit Eclipse, copy the appropriate prototypes file from GVCSiteMaker/Deployment/Migration to GVCSiteMaker/Code/GVCSMEOPrototypes/Resources/GVCSMEOPrototypes.eomodeld

2) Start Eclipse, refresh the view, then Generate EOs… for GVCVirtualTables, GVCSMCore.

3) Quit Eclipse, run the command line build (might be able to skip this step by doing a Clean… before building)

4) Start Eclipse, refresh the view, optionally update the connection dictionary to a database using the correct PKs, and finally start a build
