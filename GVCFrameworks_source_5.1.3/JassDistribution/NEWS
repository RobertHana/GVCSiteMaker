jass-2.0.11
 - fixed JassDoc to produce output even for the constructors' contracts and
   the class invariant.
   (JassDoc works with Java < 1.4 only!  see Documentation -> JavaDoc Support)
 - new attribute in ant task: docmode = "java" "html" "none" corresponding
   to the commandline options "-javadoc" "-htmldoc" "-nodoc"

jass-2.0.10
 - fixed a NullPointerException when invoking Jass on classes in
   unnamed packages and without specifying a destination directory.
 - fixed the field lookup (allowing inherited fields to be used in 
   assertions) 
 - fixed a problem with "conditional communications" in Jass 
   Trace Assertions. Howerever, we recommend to not use TAs! They
   perform bad and are not threadsafe!

jass-2.0.9
 - direct call to Jass from ant task (same JVM => enormous speed-up!)
 - destdir option in ant task (to support .java extension)
 - JavaDoc documentation improved (e.g. for constructors)

jass-2.0.8
 - fix for parsing compile controls 
   (Thanks to Joseph R. Kiniry for reporting this bug)
 - no invariant checking in static methods
 - genereate compilable code for internal methods that throw exceptions

jass-2.0.7
 - again a fix for the NameAnalysis
 - Compile to a different directory ("-d" option).
   ".java" extension now allowed for Jass-files.

jass-2.0.6
 - support classes that depend on classes in unnamed packages
   (Thanks to  Michel Charpentier for reporting this bug)
 - New ``handwritten'' commandline parsing solves problem
   with filenames and -help and -version switches work again.
 - ant task included in distribution (see examples.xml)
 - Generate HTML code, JavaDoc sections (Doclet included) or nothings 
   for assertions in formal comments

jass-2.0.5:
 - The assert statement of Java-1.4 is understood.
 - Classes in unnamed package are supported again.

jass-2.0.4:
 - Invariants are always non static and static methods ignore them.
 - Assignments are now allowed inside expressions.

jass-2.0.3:
 - Fixed handling of Interfaces.
 - Skip anonymous classes instead of failing.

jass-2.0.2:
 - Trace assertion can now be turned off.

jass-2.0.1:
 - Reformatted code with jindent.
 - Assertion in constructors are working now.

jass-2:
 - Trace Assertion added.
