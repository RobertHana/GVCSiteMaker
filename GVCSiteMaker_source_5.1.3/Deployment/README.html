	<title>Installing and Configuring GVC.SiteMaker Open Source Distribution</title>
</head>

<body>


<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document describes how to configure and install the GVC.SiteMaker Open Source 
distribution
<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>Note:</b></font> this installation process is designed for
use on OS X and other UNIX systems.  You will have some manual work to do on 
Windows.
</p>


<h1>Requirements</h1>
GVC.SiteMaker has the following requirements:

<h2>Java <a target="_new" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html">1.5.0</a> Runtime</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker will not run with earlier versions and has not been tested against later versions.

<h2>Licensed version of <a target="_new" href="http://www.webobjects.com">WebObjects</a> 5.4.3</h2>
A deployment installation of WebObjects will work for Ant builds (and for Eclipse builds, 
but you won't have any of the other development tools such as WOBuilder and EOModeler).
You can get a licensed version of WebObjects from these sources
<ul>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://store.apple.com">Apple Store</a></li>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://store.apple.com">Purchase of an X Serve</a></li>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://developer.apple.com">ADC, register for developers evaluation copy for OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:webobjects@apple.com">Request developers evaluation copy for Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>SQL Database with JDBC connectivity</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker has been most often tested with <a target="_new" href="http://www.FrontBase.com">FrontBase</a>
and only SQL scripts for that database are provided.
<a target="_new" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/UsingEOModeler/4WorkingWithAttributes/chapter_4_section_4.html">EOPrototypes</a>
are also provided for Oracle and MySQL.  These may not be fully up to 
date and / or tested.  If not using FrontBase, you will need to generate your
own SQL scripts to use in place of the FrontBase ones.  Other databases can be supported by
the addition of a database specific set of EOPrototypes to the GVCEOPrototypes project.
Contact GVC at info@global-village.net for help porting GVC.SiteMaker to a different database.

<h2>GVC Frameworks</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker makes extensive use of the <a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138889">GVC Frameworks</a>. 
These frameworks are included in this distribution bundle.

<h1>Contents</h1>
<b>The Open Source distribution is arranged into these directories:</b><br/><br/>
<a target="_new" href="Install/Archive">Install/Archive/</a> - the packages to be installed:
<ul>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerFrameworks.tar.gz</b> - the Open Source GVC Frameworks and GVCSMCore</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerCustomFrameworks.tar.gz</b> - usually contains only GVCSMCustom framework for a specific installation</li>
<li><b>GVCKerberos.tar.gz</b> - this framework is needed only when Kerberos authentication is in use</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerApplications.tar.gz</b> - the GVCSiteMaker, GVCSMAdmin, and GVCSMUtility applications</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerDocumentRoot.tar.gz</b> - the core document root resources to be installed for the web server</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerCustomDocumentRoot.tar.gz</b> - document root resources unique to this installation to be installed for the web server</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMakerMisc.tar.gz</b> - contains seldom needed functionality to repair data and assist in data conversions between versions</li>
</ul>

<h1>Installation</h1>
As you are reading this, it is assumed that you have unpacked the installation bundle.
You may now need to move it.  See the next section.

<h2>Install the Bundles</h2>
<p>
We use an installation script to automate the install. First, you should do is to read the
<a target="_new" href="Install/Script/README">instructions</a>
on how this installation process works. The installation script is 
<a target="_new" href="Install/Script/WOInstall.sh">Install/Script/WOInstall.sh</a>.<br/><br/>

<b>To make a fresh installation from scratch without backups:</b>
<pre>
cd Install/Script
sudo ./WOInstall.sh &lt;Installation Directory&gt;
</pre>
e.g. <code>sudo ./WOInstall.sh /Users/sitemaker</code><br/><br/>
</p>

<h2>Configure GVCSMCustom Framework</h2>
<p>
The GVCSMCustom framework contains configuration settings, and optionally code and 
components, that are unique to each installation.  Unless  you are installing a
previously customized version, you are going to need to setup the configuration.
You will find this framework in ~/Frameworks.  
<a target="_blank" href="Install/Misc/ConfigurationGuide.doc">Instructions</a> are provided on configuration options.
</p>

<h2>Follow the Installation Guide</h2>
<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="Install/Misc/Deployment Instructions.doc">Deployment Instructions</a> 
will guide you through the rest of the installation process.  By following the instructions here,
you will have already performed some of the steps in the Deployment Instructions.
