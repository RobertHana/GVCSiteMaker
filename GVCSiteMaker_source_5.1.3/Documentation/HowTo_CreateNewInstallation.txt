This is a brief description of how to create a new GVC.SiteMaker installation.
It does not describe configuration (see Configuration Instructions) nor all 
customization possibilites (see Customization Guide).

1. Go to the Custom folder in the GVCSiteMaker project in StarTeam and
   check out the most recent version of the Generic folder 
   (GVCSiteMaker\Custom\Generic).  Create all working folders.  

2. Copy the Generic directory to a directory under Custom named for the 
   installation.  Don't include spaces in this name.  The directory
   GVCSiteMaker\Custom\<installation_name> will be referred to as <custom_dir> 
   below.

   NOTE
   The contents of the Generic folder are a template for new installations and
   should ONLY be altered to reflect changes in the application.  Do NOT 
   change this when creating a new installation.

3. Edit the script <custom_dir>\BuildInstallPackage.sh 
   and change the line at the top that says
   INSTALLATION_NAME= *** FILL THIS IN ! ***
   to have the installation's name.  For example,
   INSTALLATION_NAME=UMich
   This name will be used when creating the deployment packages.  

   Further down in the file, check that SOURCE_PATH has an appropriate value.

   Change the line at the top that says
   USES_KERBEROS=*** FILL THIS IN, 1 = YES, 0 = NO ***
   to indicate if the installation will use Kerberos authentication 
   or not.  For example,
   USES_KERBEROS=1


4. Rename the file 
   <custom_dir>\GenericInstallConfigWorksheet.doc
   to <installation_name>InstallConfigWorksheet.doc or just 
   InstallConfigWorksheet.doc.  The configuration for this installation
   should be noted in this document.

5. Check <custom_dir> into StarTeam.

6. Create one or more styles, and place the HTML here:
   <custom_dir>\GVCSMCustom\StyleTemplates
   and the images etc. (if any) here:
   <custom_dir>\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Styles\<style_id>

7. If any of the standard application images from
   GVCSiteMaker\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Images
   or
   GVCSiteMaker\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Application
   will be replaced for this installation, then put the replacement images here
   <custom_dir>\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Images
   <custom_dir>\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Application

8. If any custom images are needed for this installation (e.g. to support
   custom pages), put them here:
   <custom_dir>\DocumentRoot\GVCSiteMaker\Custom

9. Once the configuation document (see 4 above is complete), open up the 
   GVCSMCustom framework at <custom_dir>\GVCSMCustom
   Update the GVCSiteMakerCustom.plist and GVCSiteMakerBootstrap.plist files 
   in the resources suitcase to reflect the configuration in the
   InstallConfigWorksheet.doc.  Refer to the Configuration Instructions
   document if you are unsure of how to configure something.

10. If Kerberos will be used, copy the jsci_license.jar file to
    <custom_dir>\GVCSMCustom and edit 
    <custom_dir>\GVCSMCustom\build.xml under the build.woframework target
    to have this section:
        <lib dir=".">
          <include name="jcsi_license.jar"/>
          <exclude name="**/*.woa/**"/>
        </lib>

The next step is often not needed and can probably only be done with an 
in-depth knowledge of GVC.SiteMaker.  More detailed instructions are 
forthcoming in the Customization Guide.

11. If custom pages are needed, add them to the <custom_dir>\GVCSMCustom
    framework.  You may need to alter GVCSiteMakerPageMap.plist or 
    GVCSMAdminPageMap.plist for these pages to get used.

12. Edit the /editlive/gvcsitemaker_editliveconfig.xml in the DocumentRoot.
    This contains the configuration and license for EditLive.  The license in the
    file is a development license.  It needs to be replaced.  See
    http://www.ephox.com/product/editliveforjava/configuration/default.asp 
    for an applet to edit / generate this file.
