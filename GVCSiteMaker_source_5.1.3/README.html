	<title>Building GVC.SiteMaker From Source</title>
</head>

<body>


<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document describes how to use Ant and / or Eclipse to build GVC.SiteMaker 
from source.  The easiest way to do this is by using Ant at the command line.  
Setting these applications and frameworks up in Eclipse, so that you can work on 
the source code, requires more effort.

<font color="red"><b>Note: </b></font>Some of the documents referenced are for our
own internal use and may have references that you are unfamiliar with or which are not
publicly available.  We will try to note where this happens.  In particular, StarTeam
is the revision control system that we use.  It is like CVS.  When you see StarTeam 
just think "CVS" or "source repository".
</p>


<h1>Requirements</h1>
GVC.SiteMaker has the following requirements:

<h2>Java <a target="_new" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">1.4.2</a> Runtime</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker will not run with JDK 1.3 and have not been tested against JDK 1.5.

<h2>Licensed version of <a target="_new" href="http://www.webobjects.com">WebObjects</a> 5.2.3</h2>
A deployment installation of WebObjects will work for Ant builds (and for Eclipse builds, 
but you won't have any of the other development tools such as WOBuilder and EOModeler).
You can get a licensed version of WebObjects from these sources
<ul>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://store.apple.com">Apple Store</a></li>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://store.apple.com">Purchase of an X Serve</a></li>
<li><a target="_new" href="http://developer.apple.com">ADC, register for developers evaluation copy for OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:webobjects@apple.com">Request developers evaluation copy for Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>SQL Database with JDBC connectivity</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker has been most often tested with <a target="_new" href="http://www.FrontBase.com">FrontBase</a>
and only SQL scripts for that database are provided. <a target="_new" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/UsingEOModeler/4WorkingWithAttributes/chapter_4_section_4.html">
EOPrototypes</a> are also provided for Oracle.  These may not be fully up to 
date and / or tested.  If not using FrontBase, you will need to generate your
own SQL scripts to use in place of the FrontBase ones.  Other databases can be supported by
the addition of a database specific set of EOPrototypes to the GVCEOPrototypes project.

<h2>GVC Frameworks</h2>
GVC.SiteMaker makes extensive use of the <a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138889">GVC Frameworks</a>. 
These will need to be build and installed (and imported into Eclipse if you are using that) before
GVC.SiteMaker can be built.

<h2>eoGenerator</h2>
If you want to regenerate the Java files from the models, you will need 
<a target="_new" href="http://www.rubicode.com/Software/EOGenerator/">eoGenerator</a>, otherwise it is not required.

<h1>Contents</h1>
<b>The Open Source distribution is arranged into these directories:</b><br/><br/>
<a target="_new" href="Code">Code/</a> - Main WebObjects frameworks and applications:
<ul>
<li><b>GVCSMCore</b> - this framework contains the core functionality.  This functionality can be
customized by code in GVCSMCustom (see below).</li>
<li><b>GVCSMEOPrototypes</b> - contains <a target="_new" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/UsingEOModeler/4WorkingWithAttributes/chapter_4_section_4.html">
EOPrototypes</a> for the models in GVCSMCore and GVCSMCustom.</li>
<li><b>GVCSiteMaker</b> - application handling site configuration and display</li>
<li><b>GVCSMAdmin</b> - application handling administrative functions.  Eventually this should get merged into GVCSiteMaker</li>
<li><b>GVCSMUtility</b> - contains seldom needed functionality to repair data and assist in data conversions between versions</li>
</ul>
<a target="_new" href="Custom">Custom/</a> - Versions of WebObjects framework to customize installation, scripts to build final deployment package<br/>
<a target="_new" href="DocumentRoot">DocumentRoot/</a> - resources that need to be copied into the web server's Document Root<br/>
<a target="_new" href="Documentation">Documentation/</a> - user manual, customization and configuration guides.  
A PDF version and other information is available at <a target="_new" href="http://eval.gvcsitemaker.com/clients/user_manual">www.GVCSiteMaker.com</a>.<br/>
<a target="_new" href="Deployment">Deployment/</a> - scripts and supporting material to build deployment packages<br/> 
<a target="_new" href="Tests">Tests/</a> - system test plan and supporting files<br/>


<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Download and Install GVC Frameworks</h2>
<p>
Do this first and follow all the configuration instructions for the frameworks as
that work is also needed for GVC.SiteMaker.  If you are using the pre-built version of the
frameworks, you will need to download the source code distribution and follow the 
installation and configuration steps for Ant and Eclipse included with that distribution.
</p>
<h2>Download and Unpack the Source</h2>
<p>
If you are reading this, you have probably already done this.  If not, the tar balls
of the source can be found on <a target="_blank" 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gvcsitemaker/">SourceForge</a>.  At this time we 
are not putting the individual files into CVS on SourceForge.  We are making available 
tarballs of the source projects and also pre-built versions.
<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>Hint: </b></font>Don't use paths with spaces in them.
</p>

<h2>Configure GVCSMCustom Framework</h2>
<p>
The GVCSMCustom framework contains configuration settings, and optionally code and 
components, that are unique to each installation.  Two versions are supplied in the
Custom directory.  The one in the <a target="_blank" href="Custom/Generic/GVCSMCustom">Generic</a> 
directory is a template that is intended to be used when <a target="_blank" href="Documentation/HowTo_CreateNewInstallation.txt">creating</a> 
the GVCSMCustom framework for a specific installation. The one in the 
<a target="_blank" href="Custom/OpenSource/GVCSMCustom">OpenSource</a> is intended 
for Open Source developers to use while developing. 
You will need to configure one of these before you can run GVC.SiteMaker.  
<a target="_blank" href="Documentation/ConfigurationGuide.doc">Instructions</a>
are provided on the configurations available.
</p>

<h1>Building With Ant</h1>
<p>
Once everything is installed, this is easy. Just cd into the Code directory and type:<br/>
<code>ant build</code><br/><br/>
You can build contracted (with Design by Contract enabled) versions with :<br/>
<code>ant build_dbc</code><br/><br/>
You can do a deep clean on the projects with:<br/>
<code>ant clean</code>
<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>Note: </b></font> Building the frameworks
will install them into /Library/Frameworks ($NEXT_ROOT/Local/Library/Frameworks on Windows).
</p>

<h1>Building With Eclipse</h1>
<p>
The frameworks are build order dependent and must be build before the applications. 
Your life will be easier if you do a full
build with Ant (see above) so that there are installed versions before you being
importing the projects into your workspace.  You will need to import, refresh, 
build, and refresh again each project in this order:
<ul>
<li>All GVC Frameworks</li>
<li>GVCSMEOPrototypes</li>
<li>GVCSMCore</li>
<li>GVCSMCustom</li>
<li>GVCSiteMaker</li>
<li>GVCSMAdmin</li>
<li>GVCSMUtility</li>
</ul>
If you have build problems, check the trouble shooting suggestions from the
GVC Frameworks.  These rely on the same build process.
</p>
<h1>Building With For Deployment</h1>
<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="Deployment/BuildDeploymentPackages.xml">Deployment/BuildDeploymentPackages.xml</a>
Ant script controls the deployment build process.  Once built, the final packaging of the
deployment packages for a particular installation is done with  
<a target="_blank" href="Custom/Generic/BuildInstallPackage.xml">BuildInstallPackage.xml</a> Ant
script found above each GVCSMCustom project.  These Ant scripts contain comments
explaining their use.
