This is a rough guide to how to build GVC.SiteMaker 4.6 for deployment.

Building the Generic Code
1. Make sure that you have the desired version of the GVCSiteMaker project 
   checked out and that all the files under Code, Custom, DocumentRoot and
   Deployment are Current.  

2. Make sure that you have the GVC.SiteMaker labeled versions of 
   the GVCTools frameworks checked out.

3. Run the build file to create the packages.  For example:
   cd u:/Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Deployment
   ant build_packages -f BuildDeploymentPackages.xml

   Use the test_build_packages target to generate a build that includes Jass 
   and other testing support:    
   ant test_build_packages -f BuildDeploymentPackages.xml

   This will create these files:
      GVCSiteMakerApplications.tar.gz    
      GVCSiteMakerDocumentRoot.tar.gz
      GVCSiteMakerFrameworks.tar.gz
      GVCSiteMakerMisc.tar.gz
   in .../Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Deployment/Install/Archive and
   add some other files to 
   .../Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Deployment/Install/Script

4. Run the build file to create the custom install package for an 
   installation.  You must define installation.version. For example:
   cd c:/Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Custom/UMich
   ant build_packages -f BuildInstallPackage.xml -Dinstallation.version=3.1.0 

   Use the test_build_packages target to generate a build that includes Jass 
   and other testing support:    
   ant test_build_packages -f BuildInstallPackage.xml -Dinstallation.version=3.1.test
   
   There are no command line parameres for this.  Inclusion of Kerberos support 
   is controlled by the BuildInstallPackage.sh script.

   This will create this file:
   <NAME>GVCSiteMakerInstall<version>.tar.gz
   in .../Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Custom/<NAME>

The end.
