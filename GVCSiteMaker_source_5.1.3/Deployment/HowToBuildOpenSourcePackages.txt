1. In Projects/GVCSiteMaker/Deployment do 
	./package-open-source /pathto/Projects version-number
	
2.  Go to SourceForge and login: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gvcsitemaker

3. Go to Admin, then to File Releases

4. Scroll to bottom, click Add Release under Releases.  Give it a name of the 
   version number.
   
5. Paste in some Release Notes.  http://sitemaker.umich.edu usually has a link
to some suitable notes on the new version.  Submit / Refresh so they stick.
Yes, it is an odd UI.

6. Use FTP to upload the files created in step 1.  For example (change the version
numbers!):

ftp anonymous@upload.sourceforge.net
<press return for the password>
cd incoming
put GVCFrameworks_binary_4.1.1.tar.gz
put GVCFrameworks_source_4.1.1.tar.gz
put GVCSiteMaker_source_4.1.1.tar.gz
put OpenSourceGVCSiteMakerInstall_4.1.1.tar.gz

Let each upload complete fully before continuing or you will add truncated files
to the release.

7. Click Add Files and / or Refresh View, select the four files that you just 
uploaded, and click Click Add Files and / or Refresh View again.

8. In Step 3, select "Platform-Independant" for the Processor and .gz or source
.gz for the file type.  Do this for one file at a time and press Update/Refresh
after each one.  Otherwise you changes will be lost.

9. Sent a notification if anyone is watching.
